EVO Beacon Chain is coming soon.
</p>
<p>
There will be 100M EVO tokens and 90M will be distributed to the community for free.
All you need to do is claim it by sending 0 ETH to a contract that we will provide later.
Each time you claim, 1 EVO will be minted, 0.9 will be given to you, 0.1 will be given to the team.
This will go on until all 100M EVO are distributed.
EVO will later be used as the native token for a POS chain following the footseps of ETH2.
