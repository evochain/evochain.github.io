<h1>EVO Beacon Chain is coming soon.</h1>
<h2>There will be 100M EVO tokens and 90M will be distributed to the community for free.</h2>
<h3>All you need to do is claim it by sending 0 ETH to a contract that we will provide later.</h3>
<h4>Each time you claim, 1 EVO will be minted, 0.9 will be given to you, 0.1 will be given to the team.</h4>
<h5>This will go on until all 100M EVO are distributed.</h5>
<h6>EVO will later be used as the native token for a POS chain following the footseps of ETH2.</h6>
